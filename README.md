# WMI_Detector
This repository contains scripts used to find evidence in WMI repositories, specifically OBJECTS.DATA files located at:

- C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA
- C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\FS\OBJECTS.DATA

## wmi_detector.py
wmi_detector.py is designed to find WMI persistence via FitlerToConsumerBindings
solely by keyword searching the OBJECTS.DATA file without parsing the full WMI repository.

In testing, this script has found the exact same data as python-cim's
show_FilterToConsumerBindings.py without requiring the setup. Only further testing will
indicate if this script misses any data that python-cim can find.

In theory, this script will detect FilterToConsumerBindings that are deleted and remain
in unallocated WMI space, but I haven't had a chance to test yet.

### Usage
```wmi_detector.py <OBJECTS.DATA file>```

The output is json based in the following format for each binding:
```
{
  "<consumer name>-<filter name>": {
    "binding_details": {
      "event_consumer_name": "<consumer name",
      "event_filter_name": "<filter name>"
    },
    "binding_name": "<consumer name>-<filter name>",
    "consumers": [
      {
        "consumer_arguments": "<command>",
        "consumer_name": "<consumer name>-",
        "consumer_type": "CommandLineEventConsumer"
      }
    ],
    "filters": [
      {
        "filter_name": "<filter name>",
        "filter_query": "<query>"
      }
    ],
    "info": ""
  }
}
```
An example:
```
{
  "Malicious Consumer-Malicious Filter": {
    "binding_details": {
      "event_consumer_name": "Malicious Consumer",
      "event_filter_name": "Malicious Filter"
    },
    "binding_name": "Malicious Consumer-Malicious Filter",
    "consumers": [
      {
        "consumer_arguments": "powershell.exe -Command IEX \"'echo ciao | Out-File -FilePath C:\\salve.txt'\"",
        "consumer_name": "Malicious Consumer",
        "consumer_type": "CommandLineEventConsumer"
      }
    ],
    "filters": [
      {
        "filter_name": "Malicious Filter",
        "filter_query": "SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 5 WHERE TargetInstance ISA \"Win32_Process\" AND TargetInstance.Name = \"notepad.exe\""
      }
    ],
    "info": ""
  },
  "SCM Event Log Consumer-SCM Event Log Filter": {
    "binding_details": {
      "event_consumer_name": "SCM Event Log Consumer",
      "event_filter_name": "SCM Event Log Filter"
    },
    "binding_name": "SCM Event Log Consumer-SCM Event Log Filter",
    "consumers": [
      "NTEventLogEventConsumer ~ SCM Event Log Consumer ~ sid ~ Service Control Manager"
    ],
    "filters": [
      {
        "filter_name": "SCM Event Log Filter",
        "filter_query": "select * from MSFT_SCMEventLogEvent"
      }
    ],
    "info": "Common binding based on consumer and filter names,possibly legitimate"
  }
}
```
